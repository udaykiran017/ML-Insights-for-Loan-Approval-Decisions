# ML-Insights-for-Loan-Approval-Decisions
This project applies machine learning models like KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM to predict loan status. The dataset is cleaned, and key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated. Visualizations like decision tree plots and SVM boundaries provide insights into predictions.
